# Collection of ML models used in our work

This is a collection of ML models that were used in our work:

* [ResNet50](./ResNet/)
* [ConvNeXt L](./ConvNeXt/)
* [Inception V3](./InceptionV3/)
* [Faster RCNN](./FasterRCNN/)

For other models (e.g., LISA-CNN, YOLOv3) that were specifically used for certain attacks, the original implementations were used:

* [YOLO v3](https://github.com/ssloxford/short-lived-adversarial-perturbations/tree/main/code/classifiers) (for SLAP attack)
* [LISA-CNN](https://github.com/ssloxford/short-lived-adversarial-perturbations/tree/main/code/classifiers) (for SLAP attack)
* [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/ssloxford/short-lived-adversarial-perturbations/tree/main/code/classifiers) (for SLAP attack)
* [LISA-CNN](https://github.com/evtimovi/robust_physical_perturbations/blob/master/lisa-cnn-attack/manyclassify.py) (for RP2 attack)
